## Files

### `numberGuess.py`
A classic number guessing game where:
* The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
* Players try to guess the number.
* The game provides hints ("too high" or "too low") after each attempt.
* The game continues until the correct number is guessed.

### `demo.py`
A simple dice rolling simulator that:
* Prompts the user if they'd like to roll the dice.
* Generates two random numbers (simulating dice rolls) between 1 and 6 upon request.
* Displays the outcome of the dice roll.
* Continues rolling until the user decides to quit.
